# 01-Homework - Horiseon SEO Development

## Introduction
For our first homework assignment, we were tasked with developing a basic website to improve the accesibility, semantics and structure of the code. The goal is to create a website that is optimized for search engines with HTML that has improved semantics and structure.

## Motivation
Aside from completing our first homework assignment, part of my goal was to experiment with the various features of Bootstrap in order to create a functional website that is cross-platform compatible. Overall, the website turned out decent for a first attempt, and I learned a lot about proper HTML semantics as well as how to use Bootstrap to create responsive layouts.

## Version List
### v1.0
- changed title of website
- fixed h1 span and text
- changed divs to proper HTML semantics (ex. header, nav, section, aside, article, footer, etc.)
- fixed header sequence
- changed css to reflect HTML semantic changes
- added alt text to images
- added title text to images (to display on hover)

### v2.0
- added Bootstrap framework
- added more alt and title text for aside articles
- changed navbar to dropdown menu
- changed hero to jumbotron
- rounded out borders and images for a "friendlier" look (used .card and border-radius attribute)
- changed size of article boxes to fix spacing with footer; changed font size of text balance size changes
- added container-fluid class to sections for better cross-platform compatibility
- changed height, width an margins of boxes to avoid problems with contaner-fluid class

## Framework
### Built with Bootstrap
